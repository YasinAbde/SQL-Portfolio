Jojo Family Tree: 

This was a project from Khan Academy to build a data set from scratch and display intermidiate join skills. I chose to create a dataset based off of the characters from tv show including their names, powers, seasons they were introduced, parental status, child status, and character ID number. The first statement selects the characters ID numbers and names from the CHARACTERS table. The second statement selects the season number and season subtitles. The third statement selects the names of each character and the season number they were introduced. The fourth statement selects the names of all characters who are parents, the names of their children, and the subtitles of the seasons the parents and the children were introduced. The final statement selects the subtitles of each season, the number of characters in each season and the number of characters with powers in each season.

Marvel Characters Trivia: 

This was a project from Khan Academy to use an existing dataset to test queries using aggragate functions, filtering and case functions as well as sorting using group by and order by. I chose a dataset of Marvel characters that lists their ID numbers, names, popularity, moral alignment, gender, height in meters, weight in kg, hometown, intelligence, strength, speed, durability, energy projection, and fighting skill. The first statement selects all from the table MARVELS. The second statement selects the rounded average height, weight, energy projection, and fighting skills of the characters as well as the highest intelligence and strength, and the lowest speed and durability. The third statement selects the names, genders and energy projection of characters of characters with an energy projection of greater that 3, ordered by gender and energy projection. The fourth statement creates a ranking of categories for durability starting from "squishy" and ending at "indestructable", and selects the characters names, durrability score, and durability ranking and orders them by durability. The fifth statement selects the name, gender, weight and height of each character who weight more than 60kgs and is female or is male who weighs less than 90kgs but is taller than 2 meters, and orders them by gender, weight, and height. The sixth statement selects the characters who are of good alignment and are not from the USA. The final statement selects the number of characters with a strength greater than 4 and fighting skills greater than 3 for each gender.

This was a practice challenge on HackerRank to test advanced select statement writing.

The second statement lists how many entries for each occupation there are in the OCCUPATIONS table.
