The PADS: 

This was a practice challenge on HackerRank to test advanced select statement writing. The first statement selects the name and first letter of their occupation of everyone in the OCCUPATIONS table, formats those names with parentheses around the first letter of the occupation, and orders them alphabetically. The second statement lists how many entries for each occupation there are in the OCCUPATIONS table.

Weather Observation Station 20: 

This was a practice challenge on HackerRank to test intermediate aggregate statement writing. This statement selects the median of the Northern Latitudes from the STATION table rounded to 4 decimal places.
