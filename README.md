Project Explanations

Marvel Characters Trivia: 

This was a project from Khan Academy to use an existing dataset to test queries using aggragate functions, filtering and case functions as well as sorting using group by and order by. I chose a dataset of Marvel characters that lists their ID numbers, names, popularity, moral alignment, gender, height in meters, weight in kg, hometown, intelligence, strength, speed, durability, energy projection, and fighting skill. The first statement selects all from the table MARVELS. The second statement selects the rounded average height, weight, energy projection, and fighting skills of the characters as well as the highest intelligence and strength, and the lowest speed and durability. The third statement selects the names, genders and energy projection of characters with an energy projection of greater than 3, ordered by gender and energy projection. The fourth statement creates a ranking of categories for durability starting from "squishy" and ending at "indestructable", and selects the characters names, durability score, and durability ranking and orders them by durability. The fifth statement selects the name, gender, weight and height of each character who weight more than 60 kg and is female or is male who weighs less than 90 kg but is taller than 2 meters, and orders them by gender, weight, and height. The sixth statement selects the characters who are of good alignment and are not from the USA. The final statement selects the number of characters with a strength greater than 4 and fighting skills greater than 3 for each gender.

Occupations:

This was a practice question on HackerRank to test intermediate querie writing pivoting tables. This statement selects the names from the OCCUPATIONS table and lists them alphabetically, grouping the names in columns by occupation.

The PADS: 

This was a practice challenge on HackerRank to test advanced select statement writing. The first statement selects the name and first letter of their occupation of everyone in the OCCUPATIONS table, formats those names with parentheses around the first letter of the occupation, and orders them alphabetically. The second statement lists how many entries for each occupation there are in the OCCUPATIONS table.

Weather Observation Station 20: 

This was a practice challenge on HackerRank to test intermediate aggregate statement writing. This statement selects the median of the Northern Latitudes from the STATION table rounded to 4 decimal places.
